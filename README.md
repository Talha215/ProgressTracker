# ProgressTracker
As a team we created a console based TV Show Tracker. The application gives users the ability to pick from a list of those
shows and put them into 3 categories: plan to watch, currently watching, and finished watching.
Users can have different shows in their trackers and have made different levels of progress in completing a show.
# Base Functionality 
- A console based menu where users can navigate to different options to update
and view their trackers
- Users can login with a username and password
- Each user can view a tracker where they can see what is not completed, in-progress, and completed
- Users can only access the information tied to their account and make changes to their trackers (as a developer try to think of what kinds of changes may be
useful for a user to make
